## Halifax RoadWatch is a community-based reporting and road awareness platform. 
Residents can report road damage and public infrastructure issues, while drivers can view existing reports and understand current road risk conditions across the city.

## This project is an independent prototype and is not affiliated with the Halifax Regional Municipality.
