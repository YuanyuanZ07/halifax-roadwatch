Halifax RoadWatch is a community-based reporting and road awareness platform. 
Residents can report road damage and public infrastructure issues, while drivers can view existing reports and understand current road risk conditions across the city.

This project is an independent prototype and is not affiliated with the Halifax Regional Municipality.
